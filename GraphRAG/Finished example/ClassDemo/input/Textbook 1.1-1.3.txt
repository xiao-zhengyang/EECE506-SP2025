1.1. Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering

When new fields emerge from new ideas, old terminology is usually not adequate to describe these fields. Biotechnology—and what constitutes engineering in this field—is best described with examples rather than single words or short phrases. However, it is critical to understand the cell’s inner workings to harness its machinery and engineer the cell to perform a designated task.

Biotechnology usually implies the use or development of methods for direct genetic manipulation to achieve a socially desirable goal. Such goals might include the production of a particular chemical, the development of improved plants or seeds, gene therapy, or the use of specially designed organisms to degrade wastes. For many professionals, the key element is the use of sophisticated techniques outside the cell for genetic manipulation. Others interpret biotechnology in a much broader sense, equating it with the technical use of biology for the production of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, food, and diagnostics—and may even include engineering as a subcomponent.

Many terms are used to describe engineers working with biotechnology. Bioengineering is a broad title that covers work in medical, bioprocess, agricultural, and environmental systems, and its practitioners include agricultural, electrical, mechanical, industrial, environmental, and chemical engineers among others. Biological engineering is similar but emphasizes applications to plants and animals. Metabolic engineering involves designing cells with genetically altered pathways to produce small molecules—often ones that are novel to that cell—and stresses the human design of cells for manufacturing specialty chemicals. Biochemical engineering has traditionally meant the extension of chemical engineering principles to systems that use a biological catalyst to bring about desired chemical transformations. It is often subdivided into bioreaction engineering and bioseparations, particularly for the production of biologics, chemicals, and fuels. Biomedical engineering has long been viewed as separate from biochemical engineering—even though the boundary between the two is increasingly vague, especially in areas such as cell-surface receptors and animal cell culture. Its focus is on the human body, applying engineering principles from a variety of disciplines to design medical devices, synthetic organs, novel methods for drug delivery, and to develop diagnostics and instrumentation. Another relevant term is biomolecular engineering, which the National Institutes of Health has defined as “research at the interface of biology and chemical engineering… focused at the molecular level.”

There is a difference between bioprocess engineering and biochemical engineering. In addition to chemical engineering, bioprocess engineering draws on the work of mechanical, electrical, environmental, and industrial engineers, applying the principles of their disciplines to processes that use living cells or components thereof. Detailed equipment design, sensor development, control algorithms, and manufacturing strategies can all benefit from these additional perspectives. By contrast, while biochemical engineering primarily draws from chemical engineering principles, it is not restricted to artificially constructed processes but can also be applied to natural systems. This book focuses primarily on the application of chemical engineering principles to systems containing biological catalysts—with an emphasis on those systems that make use of biotechnology. The rapidly increasing ability to determine the complete sequence of an organism’s genes now offers new opportunities for bioprocess engineers in both the design and monitoring of bioprocesses. In today’s context, the cell itself has become a designable component of an overall process.

1.2. Differing Approaches to Research for Biologists and Engineers

The fundamental training of biologists and engineers is distinctly different. In the life sciences—unlike in chemistry or physics—mathematical theories and quantitative methods (except for statistics) have traditionally played a secondary role. Most progress has come from improvements in experimental tools. As a result, biologists often work with qualitative results and rely on descriptive models that are formulated and tested. Although many biologists may have an incomplete background in mathematics, they typically excel in laboratory techniques and, more importantly, in interpreting complex experimental data.

Engineers, on the other hand, usually possess a solid grounding in the physical and mathematical sciences. In engineering, theories frequently lead to mathematical formulations, and these theories are validated by comparing predicted responses to experimental outcomes. Quantitative models and approaches—often even in complex systems—are a strength of the engineering discipline. While biologists are adept at forming testable hypotheses, designing experiments, and interpreting data from complex systems, engineers are sometimes less familiar with the experimental techniques and strategies commonly used in the life sciences.

The skills of the engineer and the life scientist are highly complementary. Converting the promises of molecular biology into new processes for manufacturing novel products requires an integration of these skills. To work effectively at this interdisciplinary level, an engineer needs a solid understanding of biology and its experimental tools. This book provides sufficient biological background to help you understand how to apply engineering principles to biosystems. However, if you are serious about becoming a bioprocess engineer, you will need to take further courses in microbiology, biochemistry, and cell biology—as well as more advanced work in bioengineering. If you already have this background, this book can serve both as a review and as a framework for applications to bioprocessing.

1.3. The Story of Penicillin: How Biologists and Engineers Work Together

In September 1928, Alexander Fleming at St. Mary’s Hospital in London was trying to isolate the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which causes boils. At that time, the technique in use involved growing the bacterium on the surface of a nutrient solution. One of the dishes had been inadvertently contaminated with a foreign particle; normally, such a contaminated plate would be discarded. However, Fleming noticed that no bacteria grew near the invading substance (see Figure 1.1).

Fleming’s genius lay in his recognition that this observation was meaningful rather than a “failed” experiment. He deduced that the zone where no bacteria grew must be due to an antibacterial agent. Recovering the foreign particle, he discovered that it was a common mold of the Penicillium genus (later identified as Penicillium notatum). Fleming nurtured the mold to grow and, using the crude extraction methods available at the time, managed to obtain a tiny quantity of the substance it secreted. He then demonstrated that this material possessed powerful antimicrobial properties—and he named the product penicillin. Although Fleming carefully preserved the culture, the discovery remained largely dormant for over a decade.

World War II provided the impetus to revive this discovery. Sulfa drugs had a rather restricted range of activity, and an antibiotic with minimal side effects and broader applicability was desperately needed. Howard Florey and Ernst Chain of Oxford decided to build on Fleming’s observations. Norman Heatley played a key role in producing enough penicillin for Chain and Florey to test its effectiveness. Trained as a biochemist and working as a bioprocess engineer, Heatley developed an assay to monitor penicillin production and determine the kinetics of fermentation, devised a culture technique that could be easily implemented, and created a novel back-extraction process to recover the very delicate product. After months of intense effort, the team produced enough penicillin to treat laboratory animals.

Eighteen months into the project, they began treating a London policeman with a blood infection. The penicillin worked wonders at first and brought the patient to the point of recovery. Unfortunately, when the supply was exhausted the man relapsed and died. Nevertheless, Florey and Chain had demonstrated that penicillin held great potential—if it could be produced in sufficient quantities. Scaling up production to meet this need would require a well-designed process and the combined efforts of engineers, microbial physiologists, and other life scientists.

The war further complicated the situation. With Great Britain’s industrial facilities entirely devoted to the war effort, Florey and his associates turned to pharmaceutical firms in the United States (which was not at war) to develop the capacity for penicillin production. Many companies and government laboratories, assisted by numerous universities, took up the challenge. Particularly prominent among these were Merck, Pfizer, Squibb, and the USDA Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois.

Early fermentation efforts were modest. A significant effort was initially directed toward the chemical synthesis of penicillin—a task that involved hundreds of chemists. Consequently, many companies were reluctant to commit to the fermentation process beyond the pilot-plant stage. It was thought that while a pilot-plant fermentation system might produce enough penicillin for clinical testing, large-scale production would eventually rely on chemical synthesis. At that time, U.S. companies had enjoyed great success with the chemical synthesis of other drugs, giving them considerable control over production. In the case of penicillin, however, chemical synthesis proved to be exceedingly difficult (it was eventually accomplished in the 1950s, but the synthesis route still does not compete with fermentation). In 1940, fermentation for pharmaceutical production was an unproven approach, and most companies were betting on chemical synthesis to ultimately dominate.

The early clinical successes were so dramatic that in 1943 the War Production Board appointed A. L. Elder to coordinate the efforts of penicillin producers and greatly increase its supply. The fermentation route was chosen. As Elder recalled, “I was ridiculed by some of my closest scientific friends for allowing myself to become associated with what obviously was to be a flop—namely, the commercial production of penicillin by a fermentation process” (from Elder, 1970). Indeed, the challenges facing the fermentation process were formidable.

Typical of most new fermentation processes was the problem of producing a valuable product at very low levels. The low rate of production per unit volume necessitated very large—and often inefficient—reactors, while the extremely low concentration (titer) made product recovery and purification very difficult. In 1939, the final concentration in a typical penicillin fermentation broth was only about 0.001 g/l. Furthermore, penicillin is a fragile, unstable product, which imposed significant constraints on recovery and purification methods.

Life scientists at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory made many major contributions to the penicillin program. One breakthrough was the development of a corn steep liquor–lactose-based medium that increased productivity about tenfold. A worldwide search by the laboratory for better producer strains of Penicillium led to the isolation of a Penicillium chrysogenum strain—recovered from a moldy cantaloupe at a Peoria fruit market—that proved superior to hundreds of other isolates. Its progeny have been used in almost all commercial penicillin fermentations.

Another major hurdle was deciding on a manufacturing process. One method involved growing the mold on the surface of moist bran, but this “bran method” was discarded because of difficulties with temperature control, sterilization, and equipment size. An alternative surface method involved growing the mold atop a quiescent liquid medium in a variety of containers—including milk bottles, which led to the term “bottle plant” for this manufacturing technique. Although the surface method yielded relatively high amounts of penicillin, it involved a long growing cycle and was very labor intensive. The first manufacturing plants were bottle plants because the method worked and could be implemented quickly.

However, it soon became clear that the surface method would not meet the full demand for penicillin. Estimates suggested that if the War Production Board’s needs were met solely by bottle plants, the required number of bottles would stretch in a continuous row from New York City to San Francisco. Engineers generally favored a submerged tank process. This method presented its own challenges—both in terms of mold physiology and in the design and operation of the tanks. It required large volumes of absolutely clean, oil- and dirt-free sterile air. Very large agitators were needed, and the mechanical seal for the agitator shaft had to be carefully designed to prevent the entry of microorganisms. Even today, issues of oxygen supply and heat removal remain critical constraints in the design of antibiotic fermenters, and contamination by foreign organisms can degrade the product as quickly as it is formed, consume nutrients before they are converted to penicillin, or even produce toxins.

In addition to these reactor design challenges, there were similar hurdles in product recovery and purification. The fragile nature of penicillin necessitated the development of special techniques—one successful approach being a combination of pH shifts and rapid liquid–liquid extraction.

Soon processes using tanks of about 10,000 gallons were built. Pfizer, for example, completed within six months the first plant for commercial production of penicillin by submerged fermentation. This plant contained 14 tanks, each with a capacity of 7,000 gallons. Later, large-scale fermenters—typically ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 liters—were developed, as shown in Figures 1.2 and 1.3.

By a combination of good luck and hard work, the United States had, by the end of World War II, developed the capacity to produce enough penicillin to treat almost 100,000 patients per year. The impact of penicillin was immediate, and the advent of antibiotics saved countless lives. Although its first impact was seen in war zones, penicillin’s overall effect was critical to the global fight against many diseases (see Figure 1.4).

This accomplishment required a high level of multidisciplinary collaboration. For example, Merck recognized that individuals who understood both engineering and biology were rare. The company paired a chemical engineer with a microbiologist for each aspect of the problem so that planning, execution, and analysis of the experimental program were done jointly—“almost as if they were one man” (Silcox in Elder, 1970).

Progress with penicillin fermentation has continued alongside an ongoing need for the interaction of biologists and engineers. Since 1939, the yield of penicillin has increased dramatically—from about 0.001 g/l to over 50 g/l in fermentation broth. This progress has come from improved understanding of mold physiology, metabolic pathways, penicillin structure, methods of mutation and selection in mold genetics, process control, and reactor design (see Figure 1.5).

Before the penicillin process, almost no chemical engineers sought specialized training in the life sciences. With the advent of modern antibiotics, however, the concept of the bioprocess engineer was born. The penicillin process established a paradigm for bioprocess development and biochemical engineering that still guides much of the profession’s thinking today. The penicillin experience shaped the mindset of bioprocess engineers, and it is for this reason that this book focuses on the penicillin story rather than on an example of producing a protein from a genetically engineered organism. Although many parallels can be drawn between the penicillin process and efforts to use recombinant DNA, no similar paradigm has yet emerged from work with genetically engineered cells. We must continually reexamine the prejudices inherited from the penicillin era.

It is you, the student, who will be best able to challenge these prejudices.
