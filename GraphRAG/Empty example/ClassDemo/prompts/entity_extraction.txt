- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

 needed, and the mechanical seal for the agitator shaft had to be carefully designed to prevent the entry of microorganisms. Even today, issues of oxygen supply and heat removal remain critical constraints in the design of antibiotic fermenters, and contamination by foreign organisms can degrade the product as quickly as it is formed, consume nutrients before they are converted to penicillin, or even produce toxins.

In addition to these reactor design challenges, there were similar hurdles in product recovery and purification. The fragile nature of penicillin necessitated the development of special techniques—one successful approach being a combination of pH shifts and rapid liquid–liquid extraction.

Soon processes using tanks of about 10,000 gallons were built. Pfizer, for example, completed within six months the first plant for commercial production of penicillin by submerged fermentation. This plant contained 14 tanks, each with a capacity of 7,000 gallons. Later, large-scale fermenters—typically ranging from 50,000 to 100,000

text:
 In 1939, the final concentration in a typical penicillin fermentation broth was only about 0.001 g/l. Furthermore, penicillin is a fragile, unstable product, which imposed significant constraints on recovery and purification methods.

Life scientists at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory made many major contributions to the penicillin program. One breakthrough was the development of a corn steep liquor–lactose-based medium that increased productivity about tenfold. A worldwide search by the laboratory for better producer strains of Penicillium led to the isolation of a Penicillium chrysogenum strain—recovered from a moldy cantaloupe at a Peoria fruit market—that proved superior to hundreds of other isolates. Its progeny have been used in almost all commercial penicillin fermentations.

Another major hurdle was deciding on a manufacturing process. One method involved growing the mold on the surface of moist bran, but this “bran method” was discarded because of difficulties with temperature
